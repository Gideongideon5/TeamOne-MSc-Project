The Projects looks at identifying highly congested traffic zones within the city of Chicago and finding possible correlation with the air quality monitors in proximity. Machine learning algorithms are implemented on the data in two phases Phase one

The algorithms are implemented on data extract from 2018 with 4 idenfied zones in the air quality index
traffic congestion zones around the city modelled in tableau
Phase two

fine tuning selected algorithm to implement on live data accessed from APIs
Modelling the traffic data and air quality concetration through a live dashboard
The repositiory has the following folders

the Python codes with extensions .ipynb that can be executed from python ide
tableau workbook with extension .twb that is implemented in Tableau deskotp 2020.4.0
R studio with .RData that has been implemented in Rstudio
the data used in this analysis is found on the following websites Air qaulity data https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data
